# Basic Geomrtry

## Line
* Line: infinite line
* Line segement: two point form a line segment
* Ray: one point to another infinite end

## Polygon

* Convex
* Concave: at least one internal angle exceeding 180 degrees


## Polytope (多胞形) and Polyhedron (多面體)

## Equivalent vector

* same magnitude and the same direction

## Classify a point relative to a line segment

using cross product

* cross product > 0, left side
* cross product < 0, right side

## Dot product between a point and plane

Ax+By+Cz = D
(A, B, C) . (x, y, z) = D

* Dot product between a point on plane and normal vector on plane means the constant value D describe in plane
